# Biography
<hr>

Welcome! My name is Takun (rhymes with “tycoon”) and I am a Ph.D. student in Sociology and Social Policy at Princeton University.  

My research interests lie at the intersection of social stratification and the sociology of education, with a focus on using quantitative methods—including causal inference, experimental designs, and computational techniques—to inform equity-promoting policies. My work seeks to address a central question: **To what extent, and how, can schooling alleviate social inequalities?** I have explored this question through three key dimensions:

* **Access to education**, examined in my master’s thesis on parental school choice.

* **The effects of schooling**, analyzed in a working paper on the heterogeneous impacts of schooling on cognitive and non-cognitive skills.

* **Institutional processes within schools**, the subject of my published papers on curriculum development and AI in educational practice.  

<br>

I graduated with a B.A. in sociology from National Taiwan University and subsequently worked as a secondary school teacher and administrator in rural Taiwan for three years. Prior to starting at Princeton, I received a M.A. in education from National Taiwan Normal University, where I earned a scholarship to visit UC Berkeley for the 2023-24 academic year.  

Currently, I’m investigating the role of standardized testing in college admissions, addressing the debate on whether such policies promote equity or reinforce privilege.
