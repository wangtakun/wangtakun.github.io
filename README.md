# Personal Academic Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal academic website, available at **[wangtakun.github.io](https://wangtakun.github.io)**.

This project was a personal endeavor to learn web development from the ground up using R Markdown to create a clean, responsive, single-page site.

## Built With

* [R](https://www.r-project.org/) & [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)
* HTML5 & CSS3
* [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for hosting

## Getting Started

To use this project as a template for your own site, you can fork this repository and modify the following core files:

* **`_site.yml`**: The main configuration file. Change the site title, navbar links, and theme here.
* **`index.Rmd`**: The R Markdown file that contains all the content for the website (biography, research, etc.).
* **`styles.css`**: The custom stylesheet. Adjust colors, fonts, and layout rules here.

## Acknowledgments

This website's structure and layout were heavily inspired by the personal website of [Prof. Sam Trejo](https://samtrejo.com). Many thanks to him for making his [repository](https://github.com/sam-trejo/sam-trejo.github.io) public.
